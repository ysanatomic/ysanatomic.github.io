Born and raised in Bulgaria, named Yordan after my grandfather, named myself *anatomic* when I was 11.

I build and break stuff - I love solving complicated, interesting problems.

Here you shall find articles mostly concerning security research - mainly kernel stuff.

Always working towards developing skills, learning more and becoming better - both professionally and personally.

Currently looking for a job so if you are recruiting and you are interested in what I can provide for your team - feel free to email me. Here is my [resume](https://github.com/ysanatomic/resume/blob/main/resume.pdf).

*My socials and email can be found in the footer of the page.*
