Born and raised in Bulgaria, named Yordan after my grandfather, named myself *anatomic* when I was 11.

I build and break stuff - I love solving complicated, interesting problems.

Here you shall find articles mostly concerning security research - mainly kernel stuff.

Trying my best not to be a *noob*, eternal search for knowledge - I *need* to be able to understand the stuff I am working with/at down to their core.

Currently looking for a job so if you are recruiting and you are interested in what I can provide for your team - feel free to email me. Here is my [resume](https://github.com/ysanatomic/resume/blob/main/resume.pdf).

*My socials and email can be found in the footer of the page.*
