Thanks for stopping by!

I am Yordan and I dissect stuff. I am especially interested in low-level software, mainly researching the Linux Kernel but I am always trying to expand my knowledge into other interesting fields (hello Browser Exploitation).  

Here you can find articles on topics mainly concerning Security and write-ups of vulnerabilities.  

I will soon be looking for a job so if you are a recruiter interested in what I can provide for your team - feel free to hit me up on Twitter or by email.

*My socials and email can be found in the footer of the page.*
