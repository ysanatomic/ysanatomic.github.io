Hello, reader - thanks for stopping by.

My name is Yordan - an 18-year-old interested in Security and Vulnerability Research.\
I am especially interested in low-level stuff, mainly researching the Linux Kernel but I am always trying to expand my knowledge into other interesting fields (hello Browser Exploitation).  

Here you can find articles on topics mainly concerning Security and write-ups of vulnerabilities.  

I will soon be looking for a job so if you are a recruiter interested in what I can provide for your team - feel free to hit me up on Twitter.

*Socials can be found in the footer of the page.*
