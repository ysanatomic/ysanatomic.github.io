Born and raised in Bulgaria, named Yordan after my grandfather, named myself *anatomic* when I was 11.

I love solving complicated, interesting problems. I might be in the *breaking* industry but I also love *building* new things.

Here you shall find articles mostly concerning security research - mainly kernel stuff.

Always working towards developing skills, learning more and becoming better - both professionally and personally.

Here is my [resume](https://github.com/ysanatomic/resume/blob/main/resume.pdf).

*My socials and email can be found in the footer of the page.*
