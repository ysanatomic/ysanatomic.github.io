Thanks for stopping by!

My name is Yordan but when online I mainly go by *"anatomic"*.

Nowadays I mostly do security research - mainly dissecting kernels but I am always trying to expand my knowledge into other interesting fields.

Here you can find articles on topics mainly concerning security and write-ups of vulnerabilities.  

I will soon be looking for a job so if you are a recruiter interested in what I can provide for your team - feel free to hit me up on Twitter or by email.

*My socials and email can be found in the footer of the page.*
